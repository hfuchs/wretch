2014-06-12, I discovered, much to my chagrin, that syntax/rst.vim
unconditionally loads a couple of other synteces.  Among these is
syntax/lisp.vim which modifies is_keyword and prohibits proper word
movements (among other things) in ReST-documents.  I'll fix that in
wretch (by assigning an empty list to g:rst_syntax_code_list).
Hence this regression test.
