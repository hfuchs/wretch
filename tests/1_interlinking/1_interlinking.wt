.	[Head One]
{syntax:rst}
2013-05-08, Here's a one-word link to [> target].

Split links happen often when the link points to a multi-word target: [> Head
One].

There's yet another special case.  This used to not work with my old code: [>
target]

I wasn't paying attention to special characters: [> ~/dir]

2014-07-19, Multiple links per line are supposed to have well-defined
behaviour: When positioned inside the braces, jump to there, else jump
to the last target on the line: [> target], [> Head One].
