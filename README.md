wretch
=================

One poor sod's surprisingly superior note keeping, outlining and general
life maintenance tool (also: vim plugin).

Alright, now that the marketing angle has been dealt with, what is it,
really?  An Outliner.  Actually the second best damn outliner that I've
come across yet.  And I've seen 'em all.  Most.  Two.  The only better
outliner in existence is Emacs' Org mode.  But if you were one of our
Emacs-using overlords, you would not be looking for an outliner, now
would you?

Who is it for?  If you happen to have a file of 50.000+ lines that you
absolutely need to keep together to represent one mother of an outline,
/you/.  It might even be useful if you're throwing together a shopping
list, who knows?

Why did I write it?  Simply out of frustration with the /fantastic/
Vimoutliner[0].  Ah, I see.  Website's down.  Well, use this one[1]
(vim.org) or that one (github.com) then.  Vimoutliner is great and fully
delivers what it's tagline, 'Work fast, think well', promises.  At least
on the 'work fast' part.  I just grew tired of it's
limitations-by-design: weak body text formatting possibilities and
unfortunate performance characteristics.  Waddaya expect, I'm not gonna
go thrashing a piece of software I've been in love with for 3+ years.

Alright, now what's the deal?  One day in the future I hope to have
a shiny website that lists all of wretch's marvellous features.  For
now, I'll just leave it at: a slightly better Vimoutliner for large
outlines.  And I mean "large" in the sense of "absurdly huge".  Take
a look at the design outline, design.wt, to get a feeling for how things
work.
