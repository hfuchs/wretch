wretch
=================

One poor sod's surprisingly superior note keeping, outlining and general
life maintenance tool.

Also, a Vim plugin (with a nice little test harness).  In order to decide
whether or not this is for you, ask yourself:

    Have I been unhappy with Vimoutliner lately?

If so, give it a try, because wretch

  + sports non-indented body text with arbitray syntax highlighting;
  + integrates a frightfully simple interlinking system; and
  + is just /faster/ (still not as fast as it could be)

This makes Vimoutliner more of a hierarchical document store, in
a way[4].  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, go read the
Mission Statement below (not sure that's any better, though).  Now,


Installation
-----------------------------------------

For very good reasons, there are two ways to get wretch up and running:

  + Use Pathogen or Vundle; or
  + say `make install` (will /not/ touch your .vimrc!)

I've even provided `make uninstall`.  Make sure you have at least

    syntax on
    filetype plugin indent on

in your .vimrc.  That's it.  Try `vim design.wt` now!


Tests
-----------------------------------------

I'm /really/ proud about my test harness.  Since clever folding is 75%
of wretch's appeal (the other 25% being non-indented body text), simply
comparing buffers[3] isn't going to cut it.  That's why I invented the

    tmux-leveraging console application test workflowâ„¢

Say `make test` and weep.


Vanity/Mission Statement
-----------------------------------------

wretch, eh?  What is it?

An Outliner.  Actually the second best damn outliner that I've come
across yet.  And I've seen 'em all.  Most.  Three at least.  The only
better outliner in existence is Emacs' Org mode, I'd wager.  But if you
were one of our Emacs-using overlords, you would not be shopping around
for an alternative outliner, now would you?

Who is it for?  Realistically, users that have out-grown Vimoutliner in
the same general direction that I did.  I /really/ think you should give
Vimoutliner a try if you haven't.  In any case, if you're stuborn and
you happen to have a file of 50.000+ lines that you absolutely need to
keep together to represent one mother of an outline, then by all means,
go ahead.  It might even be useful if you're throwing together a shopping
list, who knows?

Why did I write it?  Simply out of frustration with the /fantastic/
Vimoutliner[0].  Vimoutliner is truly great and fully delivers what it's
tagline, 'Work fast, think well', promises.  At least as regards the
'work fast' part.  I just grew tired of it's limitations-by-design: weak
body text formatting possibilities and unfortunate performance
characteristics.  Waddaya expect, I'm not gonna go thrashing a piece of
software I've been in love with for 4+ years.

What's the deal?  One day in the future I hope to have a shiny website.
For now, I'll just leave it at: wretch's a slightly better Vimoutliner
for large outlines.  And I mean "large" in the sense of "absurdly huge".
Take a look at the design outline, design.wt, to get a feeling for how
things work.

Documentation is, of course, non-existent at this point.  Bothers me.
It really does.
